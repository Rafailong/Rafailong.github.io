title: Path to FP - What is FP?
---

**Define functional programming.**

FP (Functional Programming) is programming with valid (pure) functions and nothing more. FP is based on composition, not only about composing functions, composing types, and algebraic data structures; it also makes concurrency composable.

**List the most popular characteristics of functional programming languages.**

- Immutability
- Static types
- Lazy evaluation
- Support of high order and composition of functions
- Functions as first class citizens
- Expression-based syntax
- Referentially transparent
- Curry/Currying
- Anonymous functions
- Recursion
- No side effects
- Closures
