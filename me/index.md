Hi there!

My name is Rafael Avila. I am a software developer who loves JavaScript and a functional programmer in progress.

# What do you do?
I make website and mostly back-end APIs.

# What programming languages do you use?
I really love JavaScript and Node.js but currently I am using Java and Scala. Don't tell JS that I have an affair with Scala and it seems that it will be more than that!
